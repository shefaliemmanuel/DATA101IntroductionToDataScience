#5.6.7.5
#Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. 
#Consider the following scenarios:
#A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
#A flight is always 10 minutes late.
#A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
#99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.
#Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
