#5.5.2.4
#Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. 
#How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank()

filter(flights, min_rank(desc(dep_delay))<=10)
# or 
flights %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = dep_delay)

#min_rank() is the most usual type of ranking (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th)
#default gives smallest values the small ranks; use desc(x) to give the largest values the smallest ranks.
#is the same thing as rank(ties.method = "min")
#reference: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/ranking.html

#5.6.7.5
#Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights.

#Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
#Arrival delay is most important because if it was departure delay, the flight would have time to make up for the difference while in the air
#Also with departure delay, the customer is able to nofity any post flight requirements of their current flight status till take off

#5.7.1.2
#Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>% #group by talinum
  filter(all(is.na(arr_delay))) %>% #is.na determines if a value is missing, in this case there are 7 values missing
  tally(sort=TRUE) # sort output in descending order of n

# I would not say 1 plan has the worst on-time record since 7 did not even show up. I would say these 7 all equally have the worst time on record.
